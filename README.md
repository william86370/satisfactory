# satisfactory

Just a simple satisfactory server in containers for a containerised world.

No matter which service or installation method the server needs a minimum of 4 GB RAM and 10 GB of storage space. 
It is recommended to run a server with 6+ GB RAM and more storage space to support 4+ players and or large/complex factories.
Ram usage on servers appears to be exactly the same as when loading the same save on client, your mileage may vary.
